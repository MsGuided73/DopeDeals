Looking at the current VIP Smoke codebase, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is not implemented yet. This is a significant gap that should be addressed for better search visibility and organic traffic.

Current SEO Status: Not Implemented
Based on my analysis of the code, here's what's missing and what should be added:

Missing SEO Elements:
Meta Tags: No title, description, or keyword meta tags
Open Graph Tags: No social media sharing optimization
Structured Data: No JSON-LD schema markup for products
XML Sitemap: No sitemap generation
Robots.txt: No search engine crawling directives
URL Structure: Using client-side routing without SEO-friendly URLs
Image Optimization: No alt tags or optimized image loading
Page Speed: No performance optimizations for Core Web Vitals
Recommended SEO Implementation Plan:
Phase 1: Basic SEO Foundation

Add dynamic meta tags for each page
Implement Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
Add proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3)
Optimize image alt tags and loading
Phase 2: E-commerce SEO

Product schema markup (JSON-LD)
Category page optimization
Breadcrumb navigation
Product review schema
Phase 3: Technical SEO

XML sitemap generation
Robots.txt configuration
Server-side rendering (SSR) for better crawlability
Canonical URLs
Phase 4: Performance SEO

Image optimization and lazy loading
Core Web Vitals optimization
Mobile-first responsive design (already partially implemented)
Priority for VIP Smoke:
Given that this is an e-commerce platform for paraphernalia/CBD products, SEO is critical because:

Organic search is often the primary traffic source for e-commerce
Age-restricted products have limited advertising options
Local SEO could be important for compliance and targeting
Recommendation: Add SEO implementation as a high-priority task in Phase 3 of your development plan, right after the Zoho integration is complete.

Would you like me to start implementing basic SEO elements like meta tags and structured data for the product pages?
