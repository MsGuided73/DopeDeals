- **Real-time API** for live features
- **Built-in REST API** (optional, we'll use Drizzle)
- **Advanced security** with row-level security

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase DATABASE_URL

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Database**
3. Find **Connection string** section
4. Copy the **URI** format connection string
5. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual database password

Example format:
```
postgresql://postgres.xxx:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@xxx.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

### Step 2: Update Environment Variable

Once you provide the DATABASE_URL, I'll:
1. Add it to Replit Secrets
2. Update the database configuration
3. Restart the application

### Step 3: Automatic Migration

Drizzle will automatically:
1. Connect to your Supabase database
2. Create all tables with proper schema
3. Set up indexes and relationships
4. Migrate any existing data

### Step 4: Verification

I'll verify:
- All tables created successfully
- Zoho integration endpoints work
- KajaPay payment tables ready
- Product recommendations functional
- API endpoints responding correctly

## Technical Details

### What Stays the Same
- **All existing code** (no changes needed)
- **Drizzle ORM** configuration
- **API endpoints** and logic
- **Frontend** components and queries
- **Zoho integration** infrastructure
- **KajaPay payment** system

### What Gets Better
- **Query performance** for product searches
- **Bulk insert speed** for Zoho product imports
- **Real-time capabilities** for inventory updates
- **Connection pooling** for high traffic
- **Backup and recovery** built-in

### Database Tables to Migrate
```sql
-- Core E-commerce
users, categories, brands, products
orders, order_items, cart_items
memberships, loyalty_points

-- Personalization
user_behavior, user_preferences
