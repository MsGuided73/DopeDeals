# Supabase Connection Final Checklist

## Current Status
✅ Website fully operational with memory storage  
✅ 4,500+ products loaded from Zoho integration  
❌ Database connection failing with authentication error

## The Issue
`SASL_SIGNATURE_MISMATCH` indicates authentication credentials don't match.

## Required Actions in Supabase Dashboard

### 1. Verify Project Status
- Go to your Supabase dashboard
- Check if project shows "ACTIVE" (not paused)
- If paused, click "Resume project"

### 2. Reset Database Password
- Go to Settings → Database
- Click "Reset database password"
- Set a new simple password (e.g., `newpassword123`)
- Save the new password

### 3. Get Fresh Connection String
- After password reset, copy the new Transaction pooler URL
- Should look like: `postgresql://postgres.qirbapivptotybspnbet:NEW_PASSWORD@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`

### 4. Update Replit Secret
- Update DATABASE_URL with the new connection string
- Use the exact string from Supabase (no manual encoding needed)

## Why This Should Work
- IPv4 pooler hostname: ✅ Confirmed working
- SSL configuration: ✅ Configured properly
- Postgres client: ✅ Installed and configured
- Only missing: ✅ Valid authentication credentials

## Current Workaround
The website works perfectly with memory storage, so there's no user impact. Database connection is needed for data persistence across restarts.
