# Supabase Authentication Troubleshooting

## Current Error Analysis
**Error**: `SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FINAL-MESSAGE: server signature is missing`

This error indicates:
1. **Authentication Protocol Mismatch**: The client and server can't agree on authentication method
2. **Password Hash Mismatch**: Password might be correct but stored hash is incompatible
3. **Connection Pool Issue**: Pooler authentication differs from direct connection

## Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Get Fresh Connection String
From your Supabase dashboard screenshot, we need to:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Database**
2. Under **Connection String**, copy the exact **URI** string
3. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual password `vipsmoke2025`

### Step 2: Verify Database Password
1. Go to **Settings** → **Database** 
2. Click **"Reset database password"** again
3. Set password to: `vipsmoke2025`
4. **Important**: Copy the new connection string immediately after reset

### Step 3: Alternative - Check if User Exists
The error might mean the database user doesn't exist or has wrong permissions.

## Next Steps to Try

1. **Fresh Password Reset**: Reset password one more time and get immediate connection string
2. **Direct vs Pooler**: Try both direct connection (port 5432) and pooler (port 6543)
3. **Username Format**: Verify if username should be `postgres` vs `postgres.qirbapivptotybspnbet`

## Working Connection Required
We need to establish database connection to:
- Store inventory from Zoho (4,576 products)
- Enable persistent shopping carts
- Save user preferences and recommendations
- Process orders and payments

**Priority**: This blocks all data persistence functionality.
