# NicheNexus (Dope Deals) ‚Äì Next.js App Router TODO (Post‚ÄëMigration)

> Consolidation note (2025-08-25): Active task tracking moved to taskmanage.md. This file remains for historical context.


Status: Next.js App Router migration is complete. All new work should target app/ and app/api/ using pnpm.

## ‚úÖ Phased plan to complete migration + feature buildout

### Phase 0 ‚Äî CI/Tooling stabilization (now)
- [ ] Finalize ESLint v9 flat config; local `pnpm lint` passes
- [ ] Re-enable Lint step in CI
- [ ] Scope TypeScript check to `app/` + `shared/` via `tsconfig.typecheck.json`
- [ ] Re-enable Type-check step in CI
- [ ] Add minimal vitest route smoke tests (health, products, checkout)
- Acceptance: PRs show green Lint, Type-check, Tests, and Build

### Phase 1 ‚Äî App Router migration completion
- [ ] Remove legacy `client/` and `vite.config.ts`
- [ ] Verify Tailwind content globs include `app/**` and shared paths
- [ ] Ensure `.env.example` has NEXT_PUBLIC_/server secrets documented
- Acceptance: Single Next.js app; no legacy client/Vite; envs documented



## üö® CRITICAL PATH (NOW)

1. Checkout, Payments, Inventory
- [ ] Extend POST /api/checkout to capture payment with KajaPay
  - Create KajaPay client and handle authorize/capture, refunds, voids
  - Persist paymentTransactions; link to orders; store authCode/reference
  - On success: mark order paymentStatus=paid, decrement stock atomically, clear cart
  - On failure: paymentStatus=failed; return error details
- [ ] Implement inventory reservation/decrement in Supabase
  - Validate available stock per line; decrement on success (RPC or row updates)
  - Prevent oversell; handle race conditions gracefully
- [ ] Add tax + shipping placeholders to totals
  - Tax: simple state/zip rule; plan integration with TaxJar/Avalara
  - Shipping: placeholder rate calc; plan ShipStation rate quotes

2. Auth gating and envs
- [ ] Apply requireAuth to gated pages and API routes (checkout, orders, account, admin)
- [ ] Create .env.example with NEXT_PUBLIC_* and server secrets (Supabase, Zoho, KajaPay, ShipStation)

3. Orders & Fulfillment
- [ ] Add Orders API: GET /api/orders (self), GET /api/orders/[id], PATCH /api/orders/[id]/status
- [ ] On paid order, create ShipStation order (server-side) and persist mapping
- [ ] Add KajaPay and ShipStation webhook endpoints to update statuses

## üß† AI ‚Äì Current, Ports, and New Ideas

In repo (legacy server, to port to app/api):
- [ ] AI Classification Service (/api/ai/classification)
- [ ] Emoji Recommendation System (/api/emoji/*)
- [ ] VIP Concierge AI (/api/concierge/*)
- [ ] Admin AI routes (/api/admin/ai/*) and background classifier

Additional AI‚Äëpowered features to add:
- [ ] Product content: description, bullet points, and SEO meta generation
- [ ] Image: auto alt‚Äëtext; optional background cleanup
- [ ] Personalized recommendations: embeddings + behavior; ‚ÄúSimilar items‚Äù on PDP
- [ ] Smart search & autocomplete with semantic ranking
- [ ] Fraud/risk scoring at checkout (signals + heuristics + LLM rationale)
- [ ] Support copilot (admin): suggested replies, macros, tone control
- [ ] Auto tax category/classification suggestions for catalog
- [ ] Shipping rule recommendations (packaging, carrier, service)
- [ ] Cohort insights: churn risk, VIP targeting, promo suggestions

## üîí Security & Compliance
- [ ] Zod schemas on all API routes; sanitize inputs; rate limiting
- [ ] Age verification flow (policy‚Äëdriven; state rules)
- [ ] Security headers + CSP; HTTPS settings

## üìä Observability & Quality
- [ ] Sentry for Next.js (server/client)
- [ ] Health endpoints: /api/health, /api/zoho/health, /api/kajapay/health, /api/shipstation/health
- [ ] Tests: API (checkout, orders), integration (E2E happy path), unit (utils)

## üß± Storage & Data (Supabase‚Äëfirst)
- [ ] Use SupabaseStorage by default; MemStorage for local/dev only
- [ ] Align snake_case columns and DTOs; ensure order_items, transactions mappings
- [ ] Implement stock decrement atomically; consider RPC for multi‚Äërow operations
- [ ] Remove Prisma path after parity; document RLS and table indexes

## üó∫Ô∏è Timeline (target)
- Week 1: Payments + checkout E2E, orders API, auth gating, envs
- Week 2: ShipStation create + webhooks, tax/shipping calc, admin orders screens
- Week 3: Zoho sync, catalog admin, AI ports to Next.js API, observability

## üéØ Success metrics
- [ ] 0 oversell incidents; 99% payment success
- [ ] <300ms P95 key API routes; error rate <1%
- [ ] Automated fulfillment within 5 min of payment
- [ ] Admin can manage catalog/orders without console access
